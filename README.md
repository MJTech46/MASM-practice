## Introduction
This repository includes basic programs and executables for the 8086 macro-processor. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of assembly language programming using MASM.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MJTech46/MASM-practice.git
```
### Installing DosBox
DosBox is a virtual environment that emulates an older version of Windows, allowing you to run 8086 programs. Follow these steps to install DosBox:

1. Download DosBox from the [official website](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1).
2. Install DosBox by following the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installed, open DosBox and mount your working directory:
```bash
mount c c:\path\to\your\directory
```
4. Change to the mounted directory:
```bash
c:
```
5. You can now run your 8086 programs within DosBox.

## Usage
Navigate to the `8086` directory to find the programs and executables. You can run the programs using an 8086 emulator or on a compatible system.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional programs, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
